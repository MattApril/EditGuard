TODO
---------------------
X 1. Get editToken and update the page's token if they have been logged out/in again.
	- sajax_do_call to get the token.
	- js to update the hidden input value
	
X 2. Token security
	X - check user
	X - check that EditGaurd is being used
	X - Error handling (?)
	X - string Length

X 4. Localize

X 5. Pop-up window

X 7. only use extension if client is using JS.*****

X 8. Login error handling

X 10. use sajax wherever possible. (initial check?)

X 12. IE6+ Compatible

13. Javascript function is slow to fire sometimes, usually
after you have been inactive for a while.
	- Figoure out why/solution

15. works with vector? (CSS)

X 16. add <noscript> warning below save button. (see #7)

17. Multi user - same browser, testing

18. Config variables?

19. pre-commit Javascript 
	- test all browsers (chrome, opera)
	- validate
	- DRY?

20. production testing
	- bureaucrats only?



Process:
-----------
- click
- checks session
- if timeout - display popup
	- dispaly login box - update token when login is finished
	- save = submit edit form
	- cancel = return to edit window (hide div)


Potential Issues:
--------------------
- Syncro AJAX
X - Saving pages now requires JS.
- Token Security
- SSL (will API take care of this?)
- Not compatible/useful with anonymous wikis


Notes
----------
- I Assume the API handles all escaping of login info, so i did not do it in my code.
- The time between a session expiring, and it actually being deleted by garbage collection
  creates a window for this extension to fail. This is very important for low volume servers.
	- The higher the rate of garbage collection - the more effective this extension will be.
- The server configuration (specifically dealing with cookies and sessions) will
  greatly effect the way this extension works.
